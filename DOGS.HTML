            <p>Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as
                 elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, a
                  cleft palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical conditions significantly 
                  affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds and ages,
                   and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects larger breeds or deep-
                   chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are
                    also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms,
                     and heartworms that can live in their hearts.[40]ecord study found that respiratory disease was the most common cause of death
                     in Bulldogs.[47] Puppies were more likely to die from infection or congenital disease.
                     [48] Dogs can also have some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes,
                      dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. Type 1 
                      diabetes mellitus, resembling human diabetes, is the type of diabetes seen most often in dogs
                      .[49] Their pathology is similar to that of humans, as is their response to treatment and their
                       outcomes. The genes involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of 
                       four genes in humans' related pathways Lifespan</p>

            <p>Several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs,
                including chocolate solids, causing theobromine poisoning, onions 
                and garlic, causing thiosulfate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning, grapes 
                and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol.[41] The nicotine in tobacco can also
                 be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include copious vomiting 
                 (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. The symptoms of hydrocarbon
                  mixture indigestion can be abdominal pain, aspiration pneumonia, oral ulcers, 
                  vomiting, or death.[42][43] The most common deaths among dogs were neoplasia and
                   heart disease, followed by toxicosis and gastrointestinal disease.[44][45][46] A 
                   20-year-record study found that respiratory disease was the most common cause of death
                    in Bulldogs.[47] Puppies were more likely to die from infection or congenital disease.
